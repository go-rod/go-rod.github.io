# Selectors

Rod provides lots of methods to get elements. Their names are all prefixed with `MustElement` or `Element`. If you use an IDE after you type `Element`, you will see all the available selectors like below:

![ide-selectors](ide-selectors.png)

If you hover the cursor over the method, you will see the doc of it like below:

![ide-doc](ide-doc.png)

Usually, you only need some basic knowledge of [CSS Selector](css-selector) to achieve the automation task you want to do. In the rest of the documentation we will only use CSS Selector to get elements from the page.

## By text content

Use `ElementR` to match elements with specific text content, such as select the search input in the screenshot below:

![match-text](match-text.png)

```go
page.MustElementR("input", "Search or jump")
page.MustElementR("input", "/click/i") // use the case-insensitive flag "i"
```

Since we use [js regex](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp), we don't have to match the whole text context. The text to match is what you actually see on the website, not the source code, compare 1 and 2 in the screenshot below. You can use the `copy` helper in Devtools to copy the text to your clipboard (look at the 4):

## By XPath

CSS selector is the recommended way to selector elements, such as you cannot use XPath to select [rendered text](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51992258/xpath-to-find-pseudo-element-after-in-side-a-div-element-with-out-any-content/51993454). But sometimes XPath may be handier for programmers coming from other languages. Use the `ElementX` for XPath:

```go
page.MustElementX("//h2")
```

## By Javascript

If you have a complex query or you want to use a high-level query engine, such as [jQuery](https://jquery.com/):

```go
page.MustElementByJS(`jQuery('option:selected')[0]`)
```

Actually, if you check the source code of other selectors, such as `Element` or `ElementR`, they are all based on `ElementByJS`, and `ElementByJS` is based on `Page.Evaluate`, for more details about how to evaluate js, check the [Javascript Runtime](/javascript-runtime.md). Usually, you use `ElementByJS` to create your own selector to extend Rod.

## Select list of elements

The names of the methods to get multiple elements are all prefixed with `MustElements` or `Elements`. One key difference between a single-selector and a multi-selector is the single-selector will wait for the element to appear. If a multi-selector doesn't find anything, it will immediately return an empty list.

## Traverse element tree

There are also some handy selectors to select elements inside or around an element, such as `MustParent`, `MustNext`, `MustPrevious`, etc.

Here's an example of how we use various selectors to retrieve contents from a page:

```go
// On awesome-go page, finding the specified section sect,
// and retrieving the associated projects from the page.
func main() {
    page := rod.New().MustConnect().MustPage("https://github.com/avelino/awesome-go")

    section := page.MustElementR("p", "Selenium and browser control tools").MustNext()

    // get children elements of an element
    projects := section.MustElements("li")

    for _, project := range projects {
        link := project.MustElement("a")
        log.Printf(
            "project %s (%s): '%s'",
            link.MustText(),
            link.MustProperty("href"),
            project.MustText(),
        )
    }
}
```

## Get elements from iframes

For example we have want to get the button from the nested iframes:

![iframes](iframes.png)

The code will look like:

```go
frame01 := page.MustElement("iframe").MustFrame()
iframe02 := iframe01.MustElement("iframe").MustFrame()
frame02.MustElement("button")
```

## Search elements

There's another powerful helper to get elements, the `MustSearch`. It's less precise than the selectors mentioned above, but it's handy if you want to get elements from deep nested iframes or shadow-doms.

The functionality is the same as the [Devtools' Search for nodes](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/dom#search), you can use it to find out what keyword to use to select the element you want, like the screenshot below:

![search](search.png)

To get the same element from the [Get elements from iframes](#get-elements-from-iframes), we can simply code like this:

```go
page.MustSearch("button")
```

## Race selectors

Rod encourage sleep-free automation to reduce flakiness. When an action has multiple results, we don't use sleep to wait for the page to redirect or settle down. For example, when we login a page, the password maybe incorrect, we want to handle the success and failure separately. We should avoid code like below:

```go
func main() {
    page := rod.New().MustConnect().MustPage("https://leetcode.com/accounts/login/")

    page.MustElement("#id_login").MustInput("username")
    page.MustElement("#id_password").MustInput("password").MustPress(input.Enter)

    time.Sleep(10 * time.Second) // Please avoid the use of time.Sleep!

    if page.MustHas(".nav-user-icon-base") {
        // print the username after successful login
        fmt.Println(*el.MustAttribute("title"))
    } else if page.MustHas("[data-cy=sign-in-error]") {
        // when wrong username or password
        fmt.Println(el.MustText())
    }
}
```

Instead we should code like this:

```go
func main() {
    page := rod.New().MustConnect().MustPage("https://leetcode.com/accounts/login/")

    page.MustElement("#id_login").MustInput("username")
    page.MustElement("#id_password").MustInput("password").MustPress(input.Enter)

    // It will keep polling until one selector has found a match
    page.Race().Element(".nav-user-icon-base").MustHandle(func(e *rod.Element) {
        // print the username after successful login
        fmt.Println(*e.MustAttribute("title"))
    }).Element("[data-cy=sign-in-error]").MustHandle(func(e *rod.Element) {
        // when wrong username or password
        panic(e.MustText())
    }).MustDo()
}
```
