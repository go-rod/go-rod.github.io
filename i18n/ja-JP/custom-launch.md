# Custom Browser Launch

## Connect to an running browser

You can use `launcher` lib to custom the launch of browsers, such as add or delete the browser executable command-line arguments, custom the auto-download-browser mirrors.

```bash
"/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome" --headless --remote-debugging-port=9222
```

It will output something like:

```txt
DevTools listening on ws://127.0.0.1:9222/devtools/browser/4dcf09f2-ba2b-463a-8ff5-90d27c6cc913
```

The `--` prefix is optional, such as `headless` and `--headless` are the same.

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/go-rod/rod"
)

func main() {
    u := "ws://127.0.0.1:9222/devtools/browser/4dcf09f2-ba2b-463a-8ff5-90d27c6cc913"
    rod.New().ControlURL(u).MustConnect().MustPage("https://example.com")
}
```

## The launcher lib

Because the above workflow is so often used, we abstract a the `launcher` lib to simplify launch of browsers. Such as automatically download or search for the browser executable, add or delete the browser executable command-line arguments, etc.

So the above manual launch and code becomes:

```go
func main() {
    u := launcher.New().Bin("/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome").MustLaunch()
    rod.New().ControlURL(u).MustConnect().MustPage("https://example.com")
}
```

We can use the helper function `launcher.LookPath` to get the browser executable path, the above code is the same as:

```go
func main() {
    path, _ := launcher.LookPath()
    u := launcher.New().Bin(path).MustLaunch()
    rod.New().ControlURL(u).MustConnect().MustPage("https://example.com")
}
```

If `ControlURL` is not set, the `MustConnect` will run `launcher.New().MustLaunch()` automatically. By default, the launcher will automatically download and use a statically versioned browser so that the browser behavior is consistent. So you can simplify the above code into:

```go
func main() {
    rod.New().MustConnect().MustPage("https://example.com")
}
```

## Add or remove options

You can use the `Set` and `Delete` to modify the browser launch arguments (flags):

```go
package main

import (
    "github.com/go-rod/rod"
    "github.com/go-rod/rod/lib/launcher"
)

func main() {
    u := launcher.New().
        Set("user-data-dir", "path").
        Set("headless").
        Delete("--headless").
        MustLaunch()

    rod.New().ControlURL(u).MustConnect().MustPage("https://example.com")
}
```

If you want to control every step of the launch process, such as disable the auto-download and use the system's default browser, check the [example file](https://github.com/go-rod/rod/blob/master/lib/launcher/example_test.go).

Because options like `user-data-dir`, `proxy-server`, `headless` are so often used, we added some helpers for them, so the above code can become like this:

```go
func main() {
    u := launcher.New().
        UserDataDir("path").
        Headless(true).
        Headless(false).
        MustLaunch()

    rod.New().ControlURL(u).MustConnect().MustPage("https://example.com")
}
```

Here are the available flags: [link](https://peter.sh/experiments/chromium-command-line-switches).

## Remotely manage the launcher

For production scraping system, usually, we will separate the scrapers and browsers into different clusters so that they can scale separately. Rod provides the module `launcher.Manager` to manage the launcher remotely. With it we can remotely launch a browser with custom launch flags. The example to use it is [here](https://github.com/go-rod/rod/blob/master/lib/launcher/rod-manager/main.go).

Because it's very hard to install chromium correctly on some linux distributions, Rod provides a docker image to make it consistent cross platforms. Here's an example to use it:

1. Run the rod image `docker run -p 7317:7317 ghcr.io/go-rod/rod`

2. Open another terminal and run code like this [example](https://github.com/go-rod/rod/blob/master/lib/examples/remote-launch/main.go)

The image is [tuned](https://github.com/go-rod/rod/blob/master/lib/docker/Dockerfile) for screenshots and fonts among popular natural languages. Each container can launch multiple browsers at the same time.

## User mode

When you log into your github account, and you want to reuse the login session for automation task. You can use the `launcher.NewUserMode` to launch your regular user browser. Rod will be just like a browser extension:

```go
wsURL := launcher.NewUserMode().MustLaunch()
browser := rod.New().ControlURL(wsURL).MustConnect().NoDefaultDevice()
```

Here's a more detailed example: [code example](https://github.com/go-rod/rod/blob/master/lib/examples/use-rod-like-chrome-extension/main.go).

## Low-level API

If you want to control every step of the launch process, such as disable the auto-download and use the system's default browser, check the [example file](https://github.com/go-rod/rod/blob/master/lib/launcher/example_test.go).
